A well-known weakness of the portable IBM PS/2 models P70 and P75 is their
floppy drive.  Many of the drives have failed due to leaking capacitors and/or
problems stemming from their vertical orientation.  This adapter is designed
to allow replacing a failed IBM drive with a standard PC floppy drive.

For a similar project for the less portable IBM PS/2 Model 50(Z) and Model 70,
check out {url-TubeTimeUS-Twitter}[@TubeTimeUS]'s
{url-TubeTimeUS-PS2FloppyAdapter}[PS/2 floppy drive adapter].  It was after I
found his project that I had the idea to make this version for the P7X.


Parts
-----
I designed the PCB using {url-KiCad}[KiCad 5] and ordered a small batch from
{url-Aisler}[Aisler], of which there are still some left.  Feel free to send
me an email!

Apart from the PCB, you will need the following components:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Designator | Quantity | Description

| J1         | 1        | 2x17 2.54mm shrouded pin header
| J2         | 1        | 2x17 2.54mm socket header
| J3         | 1        | floppy power connector
| R1â€“R6      | 6        | 1k 0.25W 5% axial resistor

Assembly
--------
Assembling the adapter is pretty straightforward, see the photos below.  Note
that in trying to keep the PCB small enough to physically fit in the P7X, I
had to place the components very close together.  If you use a shrouded pin
header for J1, it is easy to accidentally cover some of the neighboring
through-holes.  In my experience, the easiest way to avoid this is to solder
on the P7X-side header J1 last.

Most newer floppy drives do not need the +12V line, e.g., both of the drives I
tested work with just +5V connected.  It is there, however, in case some other
drive needs it.

Installing the Drive
--------------------
Read link:{url-Ohland-P70}[Louis Ohland's P70 page] for information on how to
remove (and install) the floppy drive.  It contains a lot of other useful
information on the P70, too.

I have personally tested the adapter with the following drive models:

* NEC FD1231H
* TEAC FD-235HF

If you end up using this adapter (or fail to) with other drives, please let me
know so I can include that information on this page.

With both drive models, I had to remove the plastic front bezel for the drive
to fit.  The eject button for the NEC FD1231H fits the hole in the P7X's drive
cover.  It is not centered and a little too small, but it works well enough.
In the case of the TEAC FD-235HF, you will have to file the eject button down
a little to make it fit.  @TubeTimeUS's project above also contains an STL
file for a custom eject button for the TEAC FD-235HF.  I have not yet tried
whether it fits the P7X.


Permanently Converting a Drive
------------------------------
Another option I explored is permanently converting a disk drive by soldering
on a converter board.  One advantage of this approach is, that the resulting
converted drive is smaller than a drive with an adapter plugged in.  This
makes it a little easier to install.  The downside is, of course, that there
is no easy way to go back.

This is what a converted TEAC FD-235HF drive looks like:

link:{imagesdir}teac-fd-235hf_3.jpg[image:teac-fd-235hf_3.jpg["From Above",width=32%]]

And here is how it compares to the ALPS-produced IBM floppy drive:

You can find the KiCad PCB in the `+converter/+` directory should you want to
follow this path.
